Financial Aid For Providing Hostel Facility To Transgender Students,faphfts,"The scheme “Financial Aid for Providing Hostel Facility to Transgender Students” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender. The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society. Due to this problematic scenario, transgender who are pursuing the scholarship scheme are forced to discontinue their studies. For addressing this issue, the Department of Social Justice has introduced this scheme that provides an amount of ₹4,000/- per month as financial assistance to the Transgender community as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation.","Under the scheme, financial assistance of ₹4,000/- per month will be provided to Transgender students as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation during the course.",1.

Main crops of the state like Bajra, Jowar, Maize, Paddy, Cotton, Tur, Moong, Urad, Groundnut, Sesamum Wheat, Gram, Mustard, and Sugarcane etc. are covered. The Department of Agriculture & Cooperation implements the PSS for procurement of oil seeds, pulses and cotton, through NAFED which is the Central nodal agency, at the MSP declared by the government. NAFED undertakes procurement as and when prices fall below the MSP. Procurement under PSS is continued till prices stabilize at or above the MSP. ﻿ Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers/farmers is very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result into undue losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs. ﻿ The Government’s price policy for agricultural commodities strives to ensure profitable prices to the growers with a vision of encouraging higher investment and production. This leads to safeguarding the consumer interest by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation. Moreover, the price policy aims at changing a balance and integrated price structure with respect to the overall needs of the economy.

Snehasparsham,s-kerala,"The Government of Kerala has launched the “Snehasparsham” scheme to protect and help unwed mothers. The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers. As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving ₹1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.","Under the scheme, financial assistance of ₹1000/- per month will be given to unwed mothers.",The applicant should be a resident of Kerala State.

SERB-Technology Translation Award,serb-tetra,"The “SERB-Technology Translation Award (SERB-TETRA)” is a new scheme launched by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India for catalyzing technology translation in academic settings. Translation research has gained considerable focus as it has the potential to elevate results from fundamental research to a given technology readiness level, in turn catalyzing symbiotic growth of institutional infrastructure to offer a platform for scale-up of entrepreneurial ventures, supported by a variety of funding mechanisms. SERB-TETRA will challenge scientists executing SERB grants, such as CRG, to establish an effective, functional, and synergistic working collaboration with an industry partner to elevate their breakthrough results and technologies to TRL level 5 and beyond. It is implicit that PIs would have obtained the necessary patents and IPRs. TETRA Support will help entities have successful ideas to kick-start new venture processes. With seed capital, flexible working spaces, and interaction between mentor and start-up entrepreneurs, the SERB-TETRA will expand the scope by providing numerous networking opportunities, followed by presenting the finished prototype to an audience of large investors, established MSMEs and private companies, and public sector enterprises. SERB-TETRA would be awarded to select PIs who have clearly demonstrated the translational potential of their research (patents, etc.) and have established contact with industrial partners for fast-track graduation to a prototype stage and beyond. PIs would have also identified technology incubators in their own institution or in the vicinity who could support their endeavors. It is envisaged that a well-defined strategy to augment research innovation, via technology incubators, will add value to the CRG and other funding mechanisms supported by SERB. Objective: SERB-TETRA aims to provide awards to competitively funded Core Research Grants (CRG) and similar projects, holding potential and promise for translation at TRL 5 or beyond. Scientific Social Responsibility: SERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society. SSR activities need to be chosen after approval and depending on the activities chosen additional budget would be provided under a separate head to carry out the chosen activities. SERB Grantees need to undertake the proposed SSR activities during their project period. Duration of Support: •	The funding will be provided normally for a period of two years.","The award will entail an unstructured budget of up to ₹15 lakhs per year (without international travel), including overhead.","Submissions under TETRA can be made only by Principal Inventors of ongoing research grants and all extramural grants completed in the last three years, where the Principal Inventor holds or applied for a patent.

Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research,tnfcr,"The Scheme “Tagore National Fellowship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging Fellows/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest. With a view to infuse fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these Fellows/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence. Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions): The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows: 1.	Group-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries 2.	Group-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship 3.	Group-C: Anthropology & Sociology 4.	Group D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts Scope of the Scheme: The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution. Duration of the Fellowship: The duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years. In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the fellow won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency. The award of the Fellowship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly. Number of Fellowships: The scheme envisages the granting of up to 15 Fellowships in a year. Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Fellowship in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers. Administration of the Scheme: The total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants.","Honorarium: A Tagore National Fellow who is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government setup in India would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization. Essential or mandatory contributions of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations as would have been paid by them had he/she continued in his/her parent organization. A Fellow from abroad or from a set-up other than University, College, Research Institute or Government service, or who has retired from active service and/or is on pension, would be entitled to a fixed honorarium of ₹80,000/- per month. No payment of honorarium would normally be made to a Fellow receiving full funding from other sources up to the level of the honorarium, but such Fellow will, however, receive a Contingency Grant, other allowances, and facilities, as decided by the NSC. Contingency Grant: In case of foreign and Indian research fellows residing or serving abroad and having been selected as Tagore Fellows under Non-MoC institutions, to and fro economy class airfare from their country of residence will be provided/reimbursed by the Ministry once during the course of the Fellowship.

The applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored). Fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution. Those who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship. Once awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.

The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well. If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution. Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution. At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.","Application Process: Step 01: The Ministry of Culture and/or the concerned institution will widely advertise the Fellowship in the leading national/regional newspapers and on its website (which should give all details) and also disseminate the scheme through professional associations/forums in the relevant fields, so that maximum publicity is accorded to the Scheme.

Process of Selection: Step 01: The received applications will be examined by the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) constituted by each participating institution for the purposes of this scheme. Step 02: The applications found worthy of consideration will be shortlisted by the ILSSC. Step 03: The selection will be based on the relevance of the study, the benefits of the nodal institution from that particular study, and the credentials and reputation of the scholar. Only such proposals may be selected that seek to (a) engage fellows who have achieved national or international recognition and proven acceptance of their work in national/ international circles; (b) bring out resources that are not yet fully out in the public domain; and (c) publish the work for the benefit of the concerned institution. The selection will be done in two stages. Step 04: The first stage will be of shortlisting of projects and candidates by the ILSSC, according to the criteria broadly specified as part of the Search-cum-Screening process. Apart from considering the applications received, the ILSSC is also expected to adopt a proactive approach to identify relevant projects and search for reputed fellows in that field, contact such fellows, and encourage them to submit their proposals. If the received proposals are not worthy of consideration, the ILSSC need not feel compelled to recommend any proposals for consideration by the NSC. Step 05: At the second stage, applications/names of short-listed candidates will be considered by the NSC for each institution.

Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yozana - Assam,mmkssy-assam,"Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state’s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana” (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19. The scheme “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed: 1.	₹ 5000/- will be provided to each farmer 2.	The number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers. 3.
